AsyncAPY - Getting started
==========================

Installing
-----------

Right now, the package is not available on PyPi because some custom dependencies need to be documented and published to the index before AsyncAPY can be succesfully installed via ``pip``.
In the meanwhile, you can clone the official `GitHub <https://github.com/nocturn9x/AsyncAPY/>`_ repo with ``git clone`` and then run the following commands in your terminal/shell (assuming ``pip`` is already installed):

- ``python3 -m pip install setuptools wheel``
- ``cd AsyncAPY-master``
- ``python3 setup.py install --prefix ~/.local``

This will install AsyncAPY and its dependencies in your system


**Note**: On Windows systems, unless you are using PowerShell, you may need to replace ``python3`` with ``py`` or ``py3`` for the commands to work, assuming you added it to ``PYTHONPATH`` when installed Python
