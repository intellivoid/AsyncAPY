Installation:
*************

The package will soon be published on PyPi, in the meantime you can clone the `official GitHub repository <https://github.com/intellivoid/AsyncAPY>_`, cd into the newly created directory
and then run the following commands (assuming ``git`` is already installed):
- ``python3 -m pip install wheel, setuptools``
- ``python3 setup.py sdist, bdist_wheel``
- ``python3 setup.py install``
- ``python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt``
- ``git clone https://github.com/netkas/ZiProto-python``
- ``cd ZiProto-Python-master``
- ``python3 setup.py install``

This will install all the required dependencies, build the distribution package and install it on the local machine
