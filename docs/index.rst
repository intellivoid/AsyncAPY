AsyncAPY - Official Documentation
====================================

AsyncAPY is a fully fledged framework to easily deploy asynchronous API endpoints over a custom-made protocol (`AsyncAProto`)

It deals with all the low level I/O stuff, error handling and async calls, exposing a high-level and easy-to-use API designed with simplicity in mind.
